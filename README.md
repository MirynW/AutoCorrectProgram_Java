# AutoCorrectProgram_Java
General auto correct program I made in my free time, plan to have it read and write from a file. Limits to about each word being 50% correct and being in the project.
 
 To run:
 Download the AutoCorrectProgram_022019.jar file
 Open Terminal, paste:
 java -jar "C:\FILEPATH\AutoCorrectProgram_022019.jar"
 and run, it will list out the words you can use.
